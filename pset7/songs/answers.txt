--- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura? ---

First i take a look at the average danceability, energy and valance for the top 100 songs with the following query.
SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(valence) FROM songs;

This returns this table:
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+
| AVG(danceability) | AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) |
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+
| 0.71646           | 0.65906     | 0.484443     |
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+

This users average 100 songs has high dancability and relatively high energy, but scoring lower on average valence.
Scoring lower in valence could indicate that the user likes songs written in minor keys, which has a non-positive feeling throughout.

By analysing the users average scores one could say that this user has a liking for songs that are danceable and with high energy and activity,
but not stricly songs with positive and uplifting characteristics. Lower score in valence could indiciate a favorisation for music written in minor keys.


--- Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. ---
--- What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose? ---

The reason why this might not be very representative of the listener is because we have very limited factors by which we are creating these "aura´s" from.
By taking into account only the top 100 songs, which is a very small porsion of the songs the average listener listens too throughout a year, we do not
get a complete enough sample size for what the listener might be listening too. We also use the average scores of danceability, energy and valence, but we
should conside other factors as these terms are too vague to go into great detail about a listers actual music taste.

I would propose to deep dive into a combination of tempo, key of the song, genre, duration, artist and artist relations to others and increasing
the sample size bigger than 100 to get a clearer picture of the listeners pattern of music. Additionally one could look at the songs that have been
played by the user but skipped within the first 30 seconds and match the relations to the top tracks within the terms mentioned earlier to get a grasp
of what songs the user actually might not like. It might be individual genres or as simple as liking the first song from a album but not the second one.

The more detailed you go about this algorithm, the more detailed picture of the listeners pattern you will be able to get.

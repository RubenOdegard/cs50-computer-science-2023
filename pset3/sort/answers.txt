sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort has a variance between best and worst case, and has the biggest difference in timing when tested on random50000.txt and sorted50000.txt

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Merge sort has little variance between best and worst case, and should be the fastest one based on Î©(n log n). Also tested on random50000.txt and sorted50000.txt

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort also has litte variance between best and worst case, but will perform worse than merge sort because of O(n2). It has to ittirate through everything in both scenarios.
